## Disclaimers

1. This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current employer, Aquia, or any previous employers.

2. The code, configurations, and resources in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. While they demonstrate security concepts, they should not be used directly in production environments without proper review, testing, and customization for your specific security and compliance requirements.

## Project Vision

This GRC Portfolio Hub is my initiative to empower Governance, Risk, and Compliance professionals in showcasing their practical AWS GRC engineering implementation skills. Drawing from my 15 years of cybersecurity experience and deep expertise in GRC Engineering, I've created this repository to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on expertise by providing ready-to-deploy labs, comprehensive guidance, and a structured portfolio framework.

My mission is to create the industry's premier open-source resource for GRC professionals to demonstrate practical AWS GRC engineering skills through guided, hands-on experiences that directly align with employer needs and AWS best practices.

## What's Inside

- **Portfolio Templates**: Professional templates for creating your GRC portfolio, optimized for GitHub and ready to showcase your skills to potential employers
- **Hands-on Labs**: Comprehensive, step-by-step labs covering core AWS security domains
- **Full Code Implementations**: Complete CloudFormation templates for all labs
- **Advanced Challenges**: Stretch goals and real-world scenarios to demonstrate advanced skills
- **Learning Resources**: Curated references, comparison charts, and learning paths

## Repository Structure

This repository is part of a progressive release strategy for my upcoming book [GRC Engineering: Building Secure, Compliant AWS Environments](https://grcengineeringbook.com/). Currently, it includes:

```
GRC_Portfolio/
├── README.md - You are here!
├── CONTRIBUTING.md - Guidelines for contributors
├── LICENSE - Project license
├── portfolio-templates/ - Templates and examples for your GRC portfolio
